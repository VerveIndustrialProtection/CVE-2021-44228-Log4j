# Usage

Import the Fixlets and Analyses into a site and apply computer subscriptions.

## Detection Methods

There are two detection methods available for each supported Operating System. It's important to understand the differences between these detectors before using them.

That being said, the way you use both detections is exactly the same. You simply action them against your devices using the OS-specific detection Fixlet and then review the results using the universal `Warning-*` Fixlets or the universal analysis for triage information.

Both detection methods correctly catalog beta/alpha versions.

### Verve Log4j Detector

The Verve Log4j Detector is an Ultra-fast low-impact detection mechanism. It does a simple search for Java processes that have loaded log4j JARs. It does not search within our JARs/WARs/etc and thus is likely to produce false negatives. 

It also cannot tell the difference between a JAR that has had its jndi class removed (a potential mitigation).

Use this to get a good sense of what you need to start work on immediately, it produces very few false positives and lets you get working immediately.

These Fixlets have minimal prerequisites. The Windows one downloads a sysinternals tool called `Handle` to do the heavy lifting.

The Fixlets for this method are:

* `Invoke - Verve Log4j Detector - Linux`
* `Invoke - Verve Log4j Detector - Windows`

### Verve Log4j Enhanced Detector

The Verve Log4j Enhanced Detector extends the Ultra-fast low-impact detection mechanism previous described by using it to identify processes on the system that have loaded JARs/WARs/etc. It then provides them to a disection tool which looks into the JAR/WAR/etc and sees if it can locate any embedded Log4j libraries.
This method can detect JARs with their JNDI class removed and will not report them as vulnerable as a result.

This method has a higher impact on the system, directly proportional to the number of open JAR/WAR/etc on the system. That being said, this method is always a lower impact than using a file system scanner.
These Fixlets have some prerequisites. Both Fixlets require a Java Runtime and so a portable JRE 8 runtime is downloaded as part of the action, used to run the detection, and then is discarded.

The Fixlets for this method are:

* `Invoke - Verve Log4j Enhanced Detector - Linux`
* `Invoke - Verve Log4j Enhanced Detector - Windows`

## Reviewing Results

To review the results of the detection Fixlets you can view the Analysis called: `Verve Log4j Detector - Results - Universal`

In addition, once the Fixlets have finished the following additional Fixlets become relevant on vulnerable machines:

* `Warning - Verve Log4j Detector reports CVE-2021-44228 - Universal`
* `Warning - Verve Log4j Detector reports CVE-2021-45046 - Universal`
* `Warning - Verve Log4j Detector reports CVE-2021-45105 - Universal`

## Cleanup

A Fixlet called `Invoke - Clear all Verve Log4j Detector results - Universal`
