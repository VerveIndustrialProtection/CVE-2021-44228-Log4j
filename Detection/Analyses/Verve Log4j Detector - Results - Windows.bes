		<Title>Verve Log4j Detector - Results - Windows</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[<P>This analysis inspects the results of the Verve Log4j Detector and pulls back troubleshooting and response information if the system has log4j present.</P>
<P>This analysis&nbsp;<STRONG>requires</STRONG> invoking the "Invoke - Verve Log4j Detector - Windows" fixlet in order to get the data required for analysis.</P>
<P>Verve Log4j Detector - Detected Log4j Paths - Windows : The paths on the system where the JAR files were detected </P>
<P>Verve Log4j Detector - Detected Log4j Names - Windows : The unique JAR names that matched the criteria</P>
<P>Verve Log4j Detector - Detected Log4j Versions - Windows : The versions of the JAR that matched the criteria</P>
<P>Verve Log4j Detector - Detected Log4j Handles - Windows : Trimmed but raw results from the scan</P>
<P>Verve Log4j Detector - Vulnerable Log4j Versions - Windows : The versions of vulnerable JAR files detected</P>
<P>Verve Log4j Detector - Vulnerable Log4j Versions Detected - Windows : True/False if a vulnerable version was found</P>
<P>Verve Log4j Detector - Last Run Time - Linux: Last time the detector ran</P>
