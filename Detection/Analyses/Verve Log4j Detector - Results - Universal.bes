		<Description><![CDATA[<P>This analysis inspects the results of the Verve Log4j Detector and pulls back data useful for analysis.</P>
<P>This analysis&nbsp;<STRONG>requires</STRONG> invoking the "Invoke - Verve Log4j Detector - *" fixlets in order to get the data required for analysis.</P>
<P><STRONG>Verve Log4j Detector - Last Run Time - Universal<BR></STRONG>The last day and time a detection was run.</P>
<P><STRONG>Verve Log4j Detector - Last Run Type - Universal</STRONG><BR>The type of detection performed.</P>
<P><STRONG>Verve Log4j Detector - Detected Log4j Versions - Universal<BR></STRONG>The detected versions of Log4j</P>
<P><STRONG>Verve Log4j Detector - Detected Log4j File Paths - Universal<BR></STRONG>Full paths to the JARs where Log4j was detected.</P>
<P><STRONG>Verve Log4j Detector - Detected Log4j File Names - Universal<BR></STRONG>Name of the JARs detected.</P>
<P><STRONG>Verve Log4j Detecter - Last Run Duration - Universal<BR></STRONG>The amount of time the last detection took to run in the format of HH:MM:SS.</P>
<P><STRONG>Verve Log4j Detector - Mitigated Log4j File Paths - Universal<BR></STRONG>If using the enhanced detection we also track the Log4j JARs we see that have had mitigations applied. This returns the paths for mitigated Log4j JARs.</P>
<P><STRONG>Verve Log4j Detector - Mitigated Log4j File Names - Universal<BR></STRONG>If using the enhanced detection we also track the Log4j JARs we see that have had mitigations applied. This returns the names&nbsp;of the&nbsp;mitigated Log4j JARs.</P>
<P><STRONG>Verve Log4j Detector - Detected Log4j JARs have been logged to Event Log - Windows<BR></STRONG>Detects if the current batch of results have been logged to the Windows Event log.</P>
<P><STRONG>Verve Log4j Detector - Fixed Log4j File Paths - Universal<BR></STRONG>If using the mitigation content, this tracks which files were fixed during the last run. This returns the paths for the fixed Log4j JARs.</P>
<P><STRONG>Verve Log4j Detector - Fixed Log4j File Names - Universal<BR></STRONG>If using the mitigation content, this tracks which files were fixed during the last run. This returns the names for the fixed Log4j JARs.</P>
<P><STRONG>Verve Log4j Detector - Unfixable Log4j File Paths - Universal<BR></STRONG>If using the mitigation content, this tracks which files could not be fixed during the last run. This returns the paths of the unfixable Log4j JARs.</P>
<P><STRONG>Verve Log4j Detector - Unfixable Log4j File Names - Universal<BR></STRONG>If using the mitigation content, this tracks which files could not be fixed during the last run. This returns the names&nbsp;of the unfixable Log4j JARs.</P>
<P><STRONG>Verve Log4j Detector - Detection Errors - Universal<BR></STRONG>If using the Enhanced Detector or Full System scanner this reports any errors that occurred during the last detection/scan.</P>
<P><STRONG>Verve Log4j Detector - Remediation Errors - Universal<BR></STRONG>If using the mitigation fixlets, this reports any errors that occurred during the last attempted mitigation.</P>
