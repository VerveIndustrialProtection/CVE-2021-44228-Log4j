		<Title>Warning - Stuck handle process on System - Windows</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[<P>This detects and stops stuck Handle processes on Systems. This is unusual.</P>
<p>This Fixlet will only work if stuck scanner action that is currently running is stopped via the BigFix console.<p>
<p>Once that action is stopped, this action will be allowed to run, will end the stuck process, and allow the invocation of a new detection action.</p>
<P><STRONG>Testing</STRONG><BR>You should always test all BigFix content on a representative set of test systems before applying it to production systems. Do not apply content you have not reviewed, tested, and have a real understanding of how it will impact your systems.</P>
