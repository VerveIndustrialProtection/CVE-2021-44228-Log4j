		<Title>Invoke - Verve Log4j Detector - macOS</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[<DIV class=subsection align=left>Invokes the Verve Log4j Detector to detect if any running processes have Log4j loaded. There are two actions available, one that looks at all processes and one that just looks at Java processes.&nbsp;The Fixlets, "Warning - Verve Log4j Detector reports CVE-####-#### - Universal" will become relevant on machines with vulnerable Log4j versions shortly after this Fixlet completes. </DIV>
<P class=subsection align=left>To target only&nbsp;systems actively running java, target the computer group "Systems running Java Processes" that was packaged with this fixlet.</P>
<P class=subsection align=left><STRONG>Notes<BR></STRONG>In order to minimize system impact, this fixlet does not look within JAR, WAR, EAR, AAR, etc files to see if Log4j is embedded inside of them. For that functionality plan to use the Enhanced Detector.</P>
<P class=subsection align=left>This Fixlet does not take into account whether or not the JAR has been mitigated by removing the JNDI class. For that functionality plan to use the Enhanced Detector.</P>
