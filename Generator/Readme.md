This repo uses a generator to generate fixlets from templates and components.

This makes it easy to fix handling/parsing logic in one place and have it impact all fixlets.

To run the generator, from powershell run `& .\Generate-Fixlets.ps1"
To "publish" the results of the generator, from powershell run `& .\Publish-Fixlets.ps1"
